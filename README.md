ALX, week 3 projects: HTML & CSS

html_basic:
This is the first project of the week where we get to know the common HTML structure or skeleton using HTML semantic elements: 
      -<header></header>: Which usually contains a logo and the navigation bar. Located at the very top of the web page.
      -<main></main>: This is reserved for the main content of the website, it can contain everything from text to images, videos, hyper links...etc
      -<footer></footer>: is the last semantic element which contains information such as copyright notices, links to relevant resources, authorship details, or any content that belongs to the bottom part of the page
This folder contains 3 different wepages : 
      -base_index.html: showcase of an example of HTML structure.
      -tweets.html: contains an embeded tweet from twitter.
      - index.html: contains slightly more advanced html structure ( Clickable image, paragraphs, links,table...etc)

html_advanced:
This directory has 2 elements, an index.html and a folder called images.
      -index.html: this webpage contains a pure advanced HTML code for a website about "learning", its also built with HTML semantic elements, with different sections and blocks containing headings, text, images.
       The <main></main> element contains 5 different sections : 
                - Banner section.
                - Quote section.
                - Videos section.
                - Membership section.
                - FAQ section.
      -images: a folder which contains all the images used in index.html
