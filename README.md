ALX, week 3 projects: HTML & CSS <br> 

<strong>html_basic:</strong><br> 
This is the first project of the week where we get to know the common HTML structure or skeleton using HTML semantic elements:  <br> 
      -header: Which usually contains a logo and the navigation bar. Located at the very top of the web page. <br> 
      -main: This is reserved for the main content of the website, it can contain everything from text to images, videos, hyper links...etc <br> 
      -footer: is the last semantic element which contains information such as copyright notices, links to relevant resources, authorship details, or any content that belongs to the bottom part of the page. <br> 
       <br> 
This folder contains 3 different wepages :  <br> 
      -base_index.html: showcase of an example of HTML structure. <br> 
      -tweets.html: contains an embeded tweet from twitter. <br> 
      - index.html: contains slightly more advanced html structure ( Clickable image, paragraphs, links,table...etc) <br> 
       <br> 
<strong><u>html_advanced:</u></strong><br> 
This directory has 2 elements, an index.html and a folder called images. <br> 
      -index.html: this webpage contains a pure advanced HTML code for a website about "learning", its also built with HTML semantic elements, with different sections and blocks containing headings, text, images. <br> 
       The <main></main> element contains 5 different sections :  <br> 
                - Banner section. <br> 
                - Quote section. <br> 
                - Videos section. <br>
